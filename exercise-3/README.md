# Exercise-2

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/INFO-201/m4-git-intro), you should begin by forking this repository, then cloning it to your local machine (if you haven't already).

In the space below, you'll provide some information about a terminal command you've learned thus far in the class. In particular, you should include the following:

A `heading` with the name of the command
An example of how it can be used (with appropriate code highlighting)
A _nested list_ of information about the command (i.e., things that it does, or how it can be used)

See `complete` branch for answers.

#`git commit -m "MESSAGE"`

1. Records changes to the repository
2. Include a log message from the user describing the changes
3. Options
..1. `-a` = commits all changes to track files since last commit
..2. `-v` = include the diffs of committed items in the commit message screen
..3. `--amend` = edit the commit message associated with the most recent commit
